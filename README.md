Welcome to my Github profile! 

Full Stack Web Frontend and Backend Developer

With over 10 years of experience, combining a firm foundation of knowledge and experience working on massive projects, I have been building and publishing numerous projects, specializing in using the following skillsets

• Web: React, Angular, Node.js, PHP/Laravel/Yii/Magento, .Net, Java, AWS Serverless Computing

• Databases: SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MS SQL and NoSQL),MongoDB, Dynamo, Firebase

• System and Software Architecture: Micro-services Architecture, Multi-tenant Architectures, Multi-tier Architecture

• DevOps: AWS, Google Cloud, CI/CD, Containers - Docker/Kubernetes

While I have worked with many large corporations, I find that my most satisfying experiences are working with smaller companies and entrepreneurs. 
I have a reputation for going up and beyond what is asked for and as a result, have a lot of repeating projects and clients.
